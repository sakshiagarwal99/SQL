# **Laptop vs. Mobile Viewership**

This is the same question as problem #3 in the SQL Chapter of [Ace the Data Science Interview](https://amzn.to/3kF79Fx)!

Assume you're given the table on user viewership categorised by device type where the three types are laptop, tablet, and phone.

Write a query that calculates the total viewership for laptops and mobile devices where mobile is defined as the sum of tablet and phone viewership. Output the total viewership for laptops as `laptop_reviews` and the total viewership for mobile devices as `mobile_views`.

### **`viewership` Table**

| Column Name | Type |
| --- | --- |
| user_id | integer |
| device_type | string ('laptop', 'tablet', 'phone') |
| view_time | timestamp |

### **`viewership` Example Input**

| user_id | device_type | view_time |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 123 | tablet | 01/02/2022 00:00:00 |
| 125 | laptop | 01/07/2022 00:00:00 |
| 128 | laptop | 02/09/2022 00:00:00 |
| 129 | phone | 02/09/2022 00:00:00 |
| 145 | tablet | 02/24/2022 00:00:00 |

### **Example Output**

| laptop_views | mobile_views |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | 3 |

### **Explanation**

Based on the example input, there are a total of 2 laptop views and 3 mobile views.

## SOLUTION

## SOLUTION 1
```
SELECT
SUM(CASE WHEN device_type = 'laptop' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS laptop_views,
SUM(CASE WHEN device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS mobile_views
FROM viewership;
```
## SOLUTION 2
```
SELECT
COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE device_type = 'laptop') AS laptop_views,
COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE device_type IN ('tablet', 'phone'))  AS mobile_views
FROM viewership;
```
